# RTI Diagnostics Application — Scope Definition

## 1. Objective

Define the scope of a desktop application built in Visual Studio Code using Codex whose purpose is to:

- Connect to an RTI Smart Home Processor (SHP)
- Discover and connect to its diagnostics interface
- Collect live diagnostics data and associated metadata
- Display diagnostics data in both raw and processed forms
- Allow filtering, session control, log level control, and export of processed diagnostics

This document defines what the application must do, not how it is implemented.

---

## 2. Application Responsibilities

The application is responsible for the following high-level functions:

1. SHP discovery and connection  
2. Live diagnostics data capture  
3. Driver diagnostics log level control  
4. Raw diagnostics display  
5. Processed diagnostics display using project-specific mappings  
6. Session management  
7. Filtering and export of processed diagnostics  

---

## 3. Application Layout Overview

The user interface is composed of **five distinct areas**:

1. Discovery / Connection / File Uploads  
2. Driver Log Level Controls  
3. Session Controls / Filtering / Export Tools  
4. Raw Logs Window  
5. Processed Logs Window  

The Raw Logs and Processed Logs windows are displayed **side by side**.

---

## 4. Discovery / Connection / File Uploads Area

This area is always visible and contains:

### 4.1 SHP Discovery

- A discovery mechanism to locate available RTI processors on the network
- Discovery is informational and does not imply automatic connection
- Discovered processors are presented in a selectable form

### 4.2 SHP Connection

- Manual IP address entry field
- Explicit connect and disconnect control
- Clear visual indication of connection state

### 4.3 Project Data Inputs

Two optional file inputs are supported:

1. **APEX Project File**
   - Represents the RTI project
   - Used exclusively for processed log interpretation
   - Not required for SHP connection
   - Not required for raw diagnostics capture
   - Read-only within the application

2. **Project Spreadsheet**
   - Supplemental project data
   - Used exclusively for processed log interpretation
   - Not required for SHP connection
   - Not required for raw diagnostics capture
   - Used to:
     - Suppress unneeded diagnostics
     - Map IDs and variables to human-readable names
     - Augment or override project metadata

Raw Logs capture must be fully functional without either file being uploaded.  
Processed Logs generation is disabled until at least one project data source is provided.

---

## 5. Driver Log Level Controls Area

- Dedicated UI area separate from discovery and session controls
- Allows viewing and modifying diagnostics log levels per driver or subsystem
- Changes affect incoming diagnostics data in real time
- Log level changes do not modify project files
- Current log level state must be visible in the UI

---

## 6. Session Controls / Filtering / Export Area

This area applies to both log windows.

### 6.1 Session Controls

- Single control to clear:
  - Raw Logs window
  - Processed Logs window
- Clearing does not disconnect from the SHP
- Resets the session state for a new diagnostics capture

### 6.2 Filtering Controls

Filtering affects display only.

Supported filter types:
- Time range
- Keyword search
- Category or message type

Filter behavior:
- Filters are applied simultaneously to:
  - Raw Logs
  - Processed Logs
- Filters never modify captured data
- Filters may be changed or cleared at any time

### 6.3 Export Controls

- User-initiated export action
- Export source: Processed Logs only
- Output format: PDF

The exported PDF must:
- Preserve log order
- Preserve text content
- Preserve color coding
- Include:
  - Project identification derived from uploaded files
  - Date and time of the diagnostics session
  - Active filters at time of export

---

## 7. Raw Logs Window

### 7.1 Purpose

- Display diagnostics data as received from the SHP
- Serve as the authoritative, unmodified data source

### 7.2 Characteristics

- Vertically scrollable  
- Append-only during an active session  
- Displays diagnostics as single-line entries  
- Each entry represents one received diagnostics message  
- Lines are formatted for readability but remain unprocessed  
- Raw JSON is never displayed  
- No suppression, mapping, or interpretation is applied  

---

## 8. Processed Logs Window

### 8.1 Purpose

- Display human-readable diagnostics derived from the Raw Logs

### 8.2 Processing Inputs

Processed Logs are generated by applying a mapping and transformation algorithm to the Raw Logs using:
- Parsed APEX project data
- Uploaded project spreadsheet data

### 8.3 Processing Behavior

The processing pipeline may:
- Suppress irrelevant or redundant log entries
- Translate numeric IDs and variables into meaningful names
- Normalize log formats into consistent, readable statements
- Apply contextual meaning based on project structure
- Apply color coding for visual clarity and quick interpretation

### 8.4 Characteristics

- Vertically scrollable
- Displays only processed, human-readable output
- Visually distinct from the Raw Logs window

---

## 9. Data Integrity Rules

- Raw diagnostics data is never modified
- All processed output must be reproducible from:
  - Raw Logs
  - Uploaded project files
- No assumptions are made about completeness of diagnostics metadata

---

## 10. Explicitly Out of Scope

The following are not part of this application:

- Sending commands to the RTI processor
- Writing or modifying RTI project data
- Editing APEX files
- Cloud storage or synchronization
- User authentication or multi-user features
- Mobile or web versions
- Automation or scheduled capture

---

## 11. Intended Use

This document is intended for:
- AI ingestion
- Scope enforcement
- Feature boundary definition
- Preventing assumption creep during development
